\textcite{Batchkarov2016} critically analyse word similarity as an evaluation
methodology for distributional semantic models.
In particular, the notion of `similarity' manifested by these models encompasses a
broad range of semantic relations \parencite[e.g.,][2]{Pado2003}, with the consequence
that performance on an intrinsic word-similarity task does not necessarily translate
to extrinsic downstream tasks \parencite[7-8]{Batchkarov2016}.
Moreover, inter-annotator agreement is generally poor for word-similarity tasks in
comparison to more specific downstream tasks \parencite[8-9]{Batchkarov2016}.
